I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Stanford University, advised by Professor [Keith Winstein](https://cs.stanford.edu/~keithw/). My research interest broadly lies in Operating Systems and Distributed Systems. I'm currently working on [Fixpoint](https://github.com/fix-project/fix), a functional operating systems for serverless computing.

Before coming to Stanford, I completed my undergraduate study at Cornell University, with majors in Computer Science and Mathematics.
